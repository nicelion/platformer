### Easy
- Name your game.
- Find your own custom artwork for blocks.
- Find your own custom artwork for the hero.
- Find your own custom artwork for enemies.
- Find your own fonts.
- Customize the background layer for a level.
- Find your own theme music


### Medium
- Design a complex standard level. Your level should be at least 60 blocks long.
- Create your own custom artwork. http://www.piskelapp.com/ is a good site for this.
- Put gaps in the blocks that run along the bottom of the level. Then make a player die when they fall through the bottom of the world. You'll need to make sure enemies that fall through are also removed from the game. Pygame's sprite.kill() function will be useful for this.


### Hard
- Change the game so that it uses the XBox controller instead of the keyboard
- Kill enemies when you land on them. You'll need to check which direction you hit the enemy from in process enemies. Award different point values for different enemy types.
### Very Hard
- Add ladders to the game. If a player is on a ladder, don't apply gravity. Assign vy by player input instead. Also disable jumping while on a ladder. You should use animated climbing images too.
