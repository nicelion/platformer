# About

Have you ever wanted to save Halloween from those blasted ghosts and skeletons? If so, Skulls and Souls is the game for you. Play as a 
Jack'o'lantern and collect bones throughout this scary world. Kill skeltors and ghosts by jumping on them, use ladders to avoid them, and make it to the end of the workd to conquer the next. Make sure you don't fall of the edge though.

# Grading

### Easy
- Name your game.
- Find your own custom artwork for blocks.
- Find your own custom artwork for the hero.
- Find your own custom artwork for enemies.
- Find your own fonts.
- Customize the background layer for a level.
- Find your own theme music


### Medium
- Design a complex standard level. Your level should be at least 60 blocks long.
- Create your own custom artwork. http://www.piskelapp.com/ is a good site for this.
- Put gaps in the blocks that run along the bottom of the level. Then make a player die when they fall through the bottom of the world. You'll need to make sure enemies that fall through are also removed from the game. Pygame's sprite.kill() function will be useful for this.

- Create cover art for your game. Save it as a PNG file. Print it in color and I'll post it in the room. (NEW)


### Hard
- Change the game so that it uses the XBox controller instead of the keyboard
- Kill enemies when you land on them. You'll need to check which direction you hit the enemy from in process enemies. Award different point values for different enemy types.
### Very Hard
- Add ladders to the game. If a player is on a ladder, don't apply gravity. Assign vy by player input instead. Also disable jumping while on a ladder. You should use animated climbing images too.
