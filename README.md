This is my platformer


### Easy
- Name your game.
- Find your own custom artwork for blocks.
- Find your own custom artwork for the hero.
- Find your own custom artwork for enemies.
- Find your own fonts.
- Customize the background layer for a level.


### Medium
- Create your own custom artwork. http://www.piskelapp.com/ is a good site for this.


### Hard
- Change the game so that it uses the XBox controller instead of the keyboard
- Kill enemies when you land on them. You'll need to check which direction you hit the enemy from in process enemies. Award different point values for different enemy types.
### Very Hard
- Add ladders to the game. If a player is on a ladder, don't apply gravity. Assign vy by player input instead. Also disable jumping while on a ladder. You should use animated climbing images too.
- Create a website for your game using GitHub Pages. Your website should include a download link, instructions for running the game which include stating the necessary version of Python and Pygame to install, and basic instructions for play including screenshots. Choose a GitHub pages theme that fits your game.
